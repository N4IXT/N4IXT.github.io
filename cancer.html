    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>In January 2025 I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Prostate Cancer. As I understand it, the cancer "eats" testosterone. The treatment is two fold.</p>
    <p>First, you stop the flow of testosterone. Then you blast the prostate with radiation which prevents the cancer from reproducing. By stopping testosterone you cut off the "food" for the cancer.</p>
    <p>The medication they put me on, to stop my testosterone production, does have some serious side affects. Lethargy is the worst, it is unpredictable. Some days I feel fine, other days I'm tired all day. Most common though is I'm good during the day but late in the day I start to tire out.</p>
    <p>Hot flashes are another nasty side affect, usually followed by cold shivers. But there is good news!</p>
    <p>I'll need to be on the medication for two years, that combined with the radiation has shown to be 98.9% successful in stopping the cancer, without it returning.</p>
    <p>As soon as I get done with being on the medication for two years, I can stop. When I do my testosterone should resume normal levels within a few weeks. It does mean, though, my life will suck during that time period.</p>
    <p>I decided to create a timer to show how long I've been on the medication, and how much longer I have left. I put it below, to have an easy to find reference on my time left on the meds.</p>
    <h3>Sharing</h3>
    <p>You may wonder why I'm sharing this. Well it is to encourage other men to get themselves checked. It can start with a simple "pee" test, where they check your PSA level. This gives the first indication of issues, and the doctors can take you from there.</p>
    <p>The good news, prostate cancer is one of the most treatable forms of cancer. But, you need to catch it as soon as possible so please, go in for your regular checkups and ensure your PSA gets checked when you do.</p>
