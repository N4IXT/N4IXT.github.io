    <h2>Crosley: Two Brothers and a Business Empire That Transformed the Nation</h2>
    <h3>An Excellent Book</h3>
    <p>If you want to learn more about the Crosley Company and its founders Powell Crosley Jr. and Lewis Crosley, then I highly recommend this book.</p>
    <p>Powell was the Elon Musk of his time. He was extremely rich, and was in a variety of business beyond just radio manufacturing. They created home appliances, airplanes, cars and car accessories, was owner of the Cincinnati Reds, and two radio stations to name but a few things.</p>
