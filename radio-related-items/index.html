    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Robert, N4IXT. I'm a ham radio operator, and very interested in the history of radio, both amateur and broadcast.</p>

<p>As you can see, I have a large collection of antique radios. The majority are Hallicrafters, in addition I have some early RCA and Atwater Kent, plus a few other miscellaneous radios.</p>

<p>I also have a rather large collection of vintage books related to radio. Some historical and many, many technical.</p>

<p>Right now I have at least one of every issue of the ARRL Handbook, going back to the very first one from 1926. I have all of the "West Coast" handbooks, almost all the QSTs, and many other magazines.</p>

<p>On this site I hope to document all of the radios in my collection. In part as I want to share with other collectors, but additionally it's gotten to where I need a good way to keep track of what I have.</p>

<p>This site is a work in progress. What you see here is a small part of my collection. More will come as I am able to find the time. I will also admit some of the pics are not the best in the world, as time permits I will be updating some photos with ones taken in better lighting and background.</p>

<p>Note, this is not a "for sale" site, none of the radios in my collection are currently for sale.</p>
