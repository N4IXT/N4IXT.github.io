    <h3>Additional Details:</h3>
    <p>While the DX-160 lacked some of the advanced features of higher-end receivers, such as digital frequency readout or advanced filtering, it provided a solid listening experience for casual users. Its simple design and ease of use made it a favorite among those new to the hobby.</p>

    <h3>Personal Note:</h3>
    <p>I owned this radio back in the 1980s. At the time I was setting up a BBS for my Commodore 64. I needed a disk drive, so wound up trading this radio for a drive.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2021. My friend who I'd traded the radio to had sadly passed away. His widow found it, and gave it back to me. It's now proudly displayed in my collection.</p>
