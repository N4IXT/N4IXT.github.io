    <h3>Personal Note</h3>
    <p>This is actually a pair of S-29s I recently acquired. The face of one is in rough shape, but has a decent body. The other is the opposite, the face is acceptable but the body is in need of help.</p>
    <p>I plan to combine the pair to make one acceptable looking radio. When I do I'll update this page with new pictures.</p>
