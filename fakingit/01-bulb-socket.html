      <h3>The Components</h3>
      <p>In the image at the top, you see the basic components needed to assemble a socket to hold your WiFi bulb.</p>
      <p>These are the basic components for what is often called a "lamp socket replacement kit". You can buy them individually, or the socket and power cord are often sold together.</p>
      <p>On the left is the power cord. Next to it is a small inline power cord switch, it clips into the power cord and has a rotating wheel which turns the power on and off. It's optional, but in a bit I'll explain why you may want one.</p>
      <p>Next is the socket itself. I suggest getting one which has the push rod for turning on and off. Avoid using a "three way" switch, most WiFi bulbs don't like them.</p>
      <p>Finally, the bulb itself. I use a VocoLinc bulb, but any WiFi bulb should work.</p>

      </div>
        <p>Above you can see the assembly of the cord to the socket. Slide the power cord into the hole in the base, then connect to the screws on either side of the socket base. Finally slide the protective sleeve over the socket base.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT!!</b> Follow the instructions that come with the power cord and lamp socket you purchase, they can vary as to which wire gets connected to which screw terminal.</p>

        </a>
      </div>
        <p>When you have everything screwed in, just bring the base up to the bottom of the sleeve and push. They generally snap together. Again read the instructions that accompany your lamp socket, as your milage may vary.</p>

        </a>
      </div>
        <p>This next step is optional, but I like to install an inline power cord switch. It's pretty simple, you snip out a very short piece of one side of the power cord and feed it through the lower half of the switch. When you snap the top on and screw it down, it pushes brass prongs into the wire you'd cut. This lets you rotate the switch to turn it on and off.</p>
        <p>So why would you want to do this if the lamp socket itself has a switch?</p>
        <p>Most WiFi "smart" bulbs are factory reset by turning the power to the bulb on and off three to four times in rapid succession. A dirty secret, often when you have the power in your house flicker, like might happen in a storm, the light bulbs mistake that as a reset command. It becomes necessary then to re-add your bulb to your home network.</p>
        <p>In our application, these bulbs will be inside heavy, bulky radios. As you see in my photos, some of these are stacked on top of each other. So in the rare circumstances where you have to do a reset, it can be a pain to unstack the radios and pull the light socket out so you can activate the power switch in the socket. Having this inline power cord switch makes it much easier.</p>
        <p>If you only have one or two radios this may be overkill, but if you have a lot, such as I have, then you'll thank yourself and save your back should this ever happen to you.</p>
        <p>This isn't something I have to do a lot, maybe once or twice a year, and certainly not to every bulb in the house. But in a storm I may have half a dozen (out of over fifty bulbs in my house) so this makes it so much easier.</p>

        <p>I use a light bulbs from <a href="" target="_blank">VocoLinc, you can get them on Amazon.</a> I selected these because I'm an Apple user, and these are Apple Homekit compatible. This means I can use the Home App built into my Apple devices to control not just these but other Homekit compatible devices from the same app. </p>
        <p>For example, I have a scene called "Meeting". It turns on my bulbs to make an attractive background, stops playing music on my Apple Homepod, and so on.</p>
        <p>You can use any bulb compatible with your home system. My only suggestion is once you pick a brand, stick with it for all the places you want to use them.</p>
        <p>On the bulb you'll see several pieces of information. Looks look at the important pieces a bit more closely.</p>

      </div>
        <p>I highly advise creating a document or a note in some notetaking app of your choice to track all of your devices. I include what I name the device, and perhaps what radio I put them in, along with the room (more on that later). </p>
        <p>In the next tutorial, Adding A Bulb in the App, I'll explain why this will be useful, but for now write down the last six digits of the MAC address. In the image you can see where this is located on the bulb.</p>

        </a>
      </div>
        <p>The final piece of information to note is the eight digit pass code for that bulb. In the image you can see it printed right next to the QR Code, in two rows of four numbers.</p>
        <p>As I'll show you in the next tutorial, if you don't have easy access to the QR Code, you can manually pick out the bulb from the MAC address then enter the pass code to add a bulb to your home system. This is very useful when the bulb is buried in a radio, or perhaps in a ceiling fixture.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In this tutorial we looked at the components needed to assemble a lamp socket for your WiFi bulb. We also looked at the bulb itself, and some of the information you need to keep track of.</p>
        <p>In the next tutorial, Adding A Bulb in the App, we'll look at how to add the bulb to your home system.</p>
