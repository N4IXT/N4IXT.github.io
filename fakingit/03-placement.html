      <p>As you can see, all you have to do is place your bulb inside the radio in a spot that will allow it to illuminate the window or shine through the dial(s). Simply move the blub around until you are happy with the effect.</p>

    <p>Run the power cord out a hole, generally you'll find one in the back of the radio to run it out. This is my RCA RADA so its a bit of an exception. Here I ran it out the top door flap. Since I'll be placing this radio on a high shelf it won't be noticed.</p>

    <p>Just a suggestion, but I'd get some of these Velcro cord straps. They help keep your cords neat and tidy. You can get them pretty cheap from Amazon or Wally Mart. Literally every cord that comes in my house gets one of these. Computer cables, power cords, you name it.</p>

    <p>Properly placed, you can give a nice glow coming from the radio, giving the illusion it is working.</p>

    <p>In this example I've changed the color to a bright white. That's the great part of these bulbs, you can set the color and the brightness however you want. This particular RADA until goes on some shelving at the end of my hallway. During the day I have it set fairly bright, but at night I set it very low to a warm amber, making for a nice night light.</p>
