    <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
    <p>If you are using the same VocoLinc app that I am, here are a series of instructions. Obviously, you'll need to start by going to the Apple App store and getting the VocoLinc App.</p>
    <p>If you've not already setup one or more rooms to place your bulbs in, at the bottom tap the Rooms link, then use the plus button to add one or more rooms. It's simple so I wont walk through it here.</p>
    <p>When done, tap the Home link at the bottom, then tap the plus button in the upper right corner to start the process of adding a bulb.</p>

          <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
          <p>First you need to select the accessory you are adding. In my example, I'm adding an L4 bulb (if you aren't sure check the box) so I tap on the L1/L4 option.</p>

          <p>Follow the instructions on the screen to reset your bulb until it is flashing. Note, they flash for a few moments, then turn off for a few seconds, then turns back on. Make sure to wait for it to come back on then tap the circle by <i>Confirmed</i>, then click <i>Next</i>.</p>

          <p>If you have easy access to the QR Code on the bulb, simply point the camera at it centering it in the blurry area (which I blurred out for this image, it's not normally blurry). </p>
          <p>The camera will pick it up, you can then tap next to move on, it will jump to Step 7.</p>
          <p>If you don't have easy access to the QR Code, instead tap the <i>More options...</i> link, and you'll proceed to Step 5.</p>

        <td>
          <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
          <p>The app will now scan the network for the bulb. Be patient it will take a moment. If you look at the screen shot, it's found a VOCOlinc and indicates it's an L4. Beside it is the MAC address of the bulb.</p>
          <p>If you refer to the previous set of instructions on <a href=01-bulb-socket.html" target="_blank">assembling the bulb socket</a>, toward the bottom I show where you can find the MAC address so you can validate what appears on the app in this step matches.</p>
          <p>Assuming it does, simply tap the little square with the bulb and MAC address on it, and you'll proceed to Step 6.</p>

          <p>It now asks for the 8 digit pass code printed on the bulb. I showed where to find this in the previous instruction <a href=01-bulb-socket.html" target="_blank">assembling the bulb socket</a>. Simply enter it and tap <i>Continue</i>.</p>

          <p>If all goes well, it should come up and all you have to do is tap <i>Add to Home</i>. Unfortunately I often have issues with this, I suspect due to some networking issues in my environment.</p>
          <p>If it fails you'll unfortunately need to fall back to the first step. Two trouble shooting tips, first you can try turning off your iPhone WiFi and back on. On a few rare occasions I've had to completely power off then back on my phone.</p>

          <p><b>Step 8</b></p>
          <p>Next you need to tell it what room to add the bulb to. I've got VocoLinc devices all over my house, you may just have one room.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in the opening, you can use the app to add rooms (or more rooms) ahead of time.</p>
          <p>You can also change the room a bulb is in by just going to its settings. It's very easy and I've done it frequently as I like to shuffle radios around in my house for keeping my displays varied and interesting.</p>
          <p>Once you pick the room just tap <i>Continue</i>.</p>

          <p><b>Step 9</b></p>
          <p>The next step is to name your device. For simplicity when adding the bulb to a radio I just use the name of the radio. In this example I'm putting it inside a 1921 RCA RADA radio, hence the name. Using the same name as the radio makes it easy to keep up with.</p>
          <p>In other places in the house I'll name it after where it's out, such as living room chair, sink, hallway, or whatever seems appropriate.</p>

          <p>Next it asks if you want to add this bulb to any automations. I prefer to do that later, in the Apple Homekit app so I just tap <i>Continue</i>.</p>
          <p>Note some bulbs support something called Adaptive Lighting. When you use adaptive lighting it can sense the room lighting and adjust the bulb accordingly.</p>
          <P>I usually just leave this enabled in this step, then in the Apple Homekit set it like I want it.</P>

          <p>If you tap on the words for the bulb tile it will bring up the settings where you can adjust the brightness and color.</p>
          <p>Note if you tap on the image of the bulb it just turns it on or off. To access the settings you have to tap in the text area on the right part of the tile.</p>

    <p>Now that you've added the bulb to your network, you are ready to put it in a radio. For some tips on that, proceed to the next tutorial, <a href="03-placement.html">Placing Your Bulb</a> </p>
