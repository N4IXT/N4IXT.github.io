     <p>The VocoLinc lightstrips are wonderful, but at $30 they may be a bit overpriced for your application. Take a look at this delightful little RCA Victor radio above.</p>
     <p>It's too small to squeeze a bulb into. In addition, the original radio had a simple white bulb, so having many colors while fun wouldn't necessarily be accurate.</p>
     <p>Never fear though, if you are looking for a budget alternative that still looks nice, you can get an USB powered lightstrip from Amazon.</p>

    <p>These lightstrips come in a few different colors, and in different lengths. I went with a three foot, warm glow version that was under $6 at the time of this writing. At that price I can easily afford to place them in many radios where I'll only want a single color illuminating the dial.</p>
    <p>While I went with the warm color, they also have bright white, red, and blue. While I can't change the color or intensity like I can with the VocoLinc strips, I am able to save a lot of money and light up other radios in my shack.</p>

    <p>Using it is simple, all I did was wove it around inside the radio until I had it positioned to give me a nice illumination on the dial.</p>
    <p>I then plugged the strip into a USB power strip, that I could use to power multiple devices.</p>
    <p>This I plugged into a VocoLinc plug, so I can turn it on an off remotely.</p>
    <p>I also use these in other spots in my house. They have an adhesive back, so I put one on the underside of my desk to illuminate that area. I've also put them on the back of bookshelves to give an attractive backlight. Finally I've also put them on the underside of my kitchen cabinets, making my wife happy.</p>
