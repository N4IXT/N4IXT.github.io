    <h2>N4IXTâ€™s Radio Extravaganza</h2>
    <p>
Hi, I'm Robert, N4IXT. I'm a ham radio operator, and very interested in the history of radio, both amateur and broadcast.

As you can see, I have a large collection of antique radios. The majority are Hallicrafters, in addition I have some early RCA and Atwater Kent, plus a few other miscellaneous radios.

I also have a rather large collection of vintage books related to radio. Some historical and many, many technical.

Right now I have at least one of every issue of the ARRL Handbook, going back to the very first one from 1926. I have all of the "West Coast" handbooks, almost all the QSTs, and many other magazines.

On this site I hope to document all of the radios in my collection. In part as I want to share with other collectors, but additionally it's gotten to where I need a good way to keep track of what I have.
