# Prompt for Copilot

You can use Copilot to produce the information to put in the contents page for each radio.

You could probably use others like ChatGPT but since I've got a Copilot subscription that's what I'm using.

Here's the prompt I'm using for specifics on a radio:

Use in GitHub Copilot in VSCode
Tell me about the rca victor model p-31 radio. Format the output as html. Format the name of the radio as an h2 tag at the very top. Under it, include the years of production at the top, in h3, labeled as "Years of Production: ". Then add then other information below it, such as technical specifications, notable features, and historical context plus any other details. I only need the code for the body area, you can omit the other areas outside the body.
