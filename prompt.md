# Prompt for Copilot

You can use Copilot to produce the information to put in the contents page for each radio.

You could probably use others like ChatGPT but since I've got a Copilot subscription that's what I'm using.

Here's the prompt I'm using:

Tell me about the hallicrafters sky buddy t5 radio. Format the output as html. Format the name of the radio as an h2 tag at the very top. Under it, include the years of production at the top, in h3, labeled as "Years of Production: ". Then add then other information below it, such as technical specifications, notable features, and historical context plus any other details. Indent the header tags six spaces, then indent other lines as appropriate. I only need the code for the body area, you can omit the other areas outside the body.
