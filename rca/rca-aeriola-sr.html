    <h2>RCA Aeriola Sr.</h2>
    <h3>Years of Production: 1922-1924</h3>
    <p>The RCA Aeriola Sr. was a high-quality regenerative receiver designed for early radio enthusiasts. It was one of the first commercially available radios that allowed users to tune into AM broadcasts with precision.</p>

    <h3>Technical Specifications:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Type: Regenerative Receiver</li>
      <li>Frequency Range: AM Broadcast Band</li>
      <li>Power Source: Battery-operated</li>
      <li>Vacuum Tube: Single triode tube</li>
      <li>Audio Output: Headphones</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notable Features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Compact and elegant wooden cabinet design</li>
      <li>Regenerative circuit for improved sensitivity and selectivity</li>
      <li>Simple tuning mechanism for ease of use</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Historical Context:</h3>
    <p>The RCA Aeriola Sr. was introduced during the early 1920s, a time when radio technology was rapidly advancing. It played a significant role in making radio more accessible to the general public, marking the transition from experimental setups to consumer-grade devices. The Aeriola Sr. is considered a collector's item today due to its historical significance and craftsmanship.</p>

    <h3>Additional Details:</h3>
    <p>The Aeriola Sr. was often paired with high-impedance headphones and required careful adjustment of the regeneration control to avoid oscillation. Its design set the standard for many radios that followed in the 1920s.</p>

    <h3>Difference Between RCA Aeriola Sr and Westinghouse Aeriola Sr</h3>
    <p>The RCA Aeriola Sr and Westinghouse Aeriola Sr were similar in design and functionality, as both were regenerative receivers. However, the Westinghouse model was produced by Westinghouse Electric, while the RCA model was marketed under the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) brand. The RCA Aeriola Sr often featured slight variations in branding and labeling, reflecting the collaboration between the two companies during the early days of radio manufacturing.</p>
    <p>The main distinction can be found in the inserts found in the lid of the radio. Looking at the example on this page, across the bottom it reads Radio Corporation of America. If you look at the label of my <a href="westinghouse-aeriola-sr.html" target="_blank>">Westinghouse Aeriola Sr.</a>, it reads Westinghouse across the bottom.</p>
