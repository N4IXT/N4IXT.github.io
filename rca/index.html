<h3>Overview of RCA Corporation</h3>
<p>The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) was an American electronics company founded in 1919. It played a pivotal role in the development of radio, television, and other communication technologies throughout the 20th century. RCA was a major force in the broadcasting industry and contributed significantly to the music and consumer electronics markets.</p>

<h3>Relationship Between RCA and Westinghouse</h3>
<p>RCA and Westinghouse had a significant relationship during the early years of RCA's formation. Westinghouse was one of the founding companies of RCA, along with General Electric (GE) and AT&T. These companies collaborated to create RCA in 1919 as a patent trust to manage and commercialize radio technology in the United States.</p>
<p>Westinghouse contributed its radio patents and expertise to RCA, which allowed the new company to dominate the radio industry. In return, Westinghouse received a stake in RCA and benefited from the commercialization of radio broadcasting. This partnership was instrumental in the rapid growth of RCA and the development of the radio industry in the 1920s.</p>
<p>However, the relationship between RCA and its founding companies, including Westinghouse, changed in 1932 when RCA became an independent company following an antitrust settlement. Despite this separation, Westinghouse continued to be a key player in the electronics and broadcasting industries, often competing with RCA in later years.</p>
<p>Because of the close relationship in the early days, I've opted to include the Westinghouse radios in my collection with the RCA radios.</p>
