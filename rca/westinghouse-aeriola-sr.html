    <h3>Historical Context</h3>
    <p>The Westinghouse Aeriola Sr was one of the early consumer radios produced during the dawn of the broadcasting era. It was designed to make radio technology accessible to the general public, allowing them to listen to the newly emerging radio stations. Its regenerative circuit, invented by Edwin Armstrong, was a groundbreaking feature that significantly enhanced its performance compared to earlier designs.</p>

    <h3>Difference Between Westinghouse Aeriola Sr and RCA Aeriola Sr</h3>
    <p>The Westinghouse Aeriola Sr and RCA Aeriola Sr were similar in design and functionality, as both were regenerative receivers. However, the Westinghouse model was produced by Westinghouse Electric, while the RCA model was marketed under the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) brand. The RCA Aeriola Sr often featured slight variations in branding and labeling, reflecting the collaboration between the two companies during the early days of radio manufacturing.</p>
    <p>The main distinction can be found in the inserts found in the lid of the radio. Looking at the example on this page, across the bottom it reads Westinghouse. If you look at the label of my <a href="rca-aeriola-sr.html" target="_blank>">RCA Aeriola Sr.</a>, it reads Radio Corporation of America across the bottom.</p>
