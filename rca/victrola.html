    <h2>Victor Victrola Model VV4-3</h2>
    <h3>Years of Production: 1925-1928</h3>
    <p>The Victor Victrola Model VV4-3 was a popular phonograph produced during the mid-1920s. It was designed as a compact and affordable option for consumers, featuring a wooden cabinet with a built-in speaker and storage for 78 RPM records.</p>
    <p>This Victrola was produced prior to the purchase of the Victor Talking Machine Company by RCA (Radio Corporation of America). Since Victor equipment is often included with RCA information in books and online resources, I included it here in the RCA section.</p>
    <p>According to online sources, the serial number on this particular Victorla indicates it was built in 1927.</p>

    <h3>Historical Context</h3>
    <p>The Victor Victrola Model VV4-3 was produced by the Victor Talking Machine Company, which was a leading manufacturer of phonographs and records in the early 20th century. This model predates the acquisition of the Victor Talking Machine Company by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1929. After the acquisition, RCA Victor became a prominent name in the audio and recording industry.</p>

    <h3>The "His Master's Voice" Logo</h3>
    <p>The iconic logo of a dog listening to a phonograph, known as "His Master's Voice," originated with the Victor Talking Machine Company. The image was based on a painting by Francis Barraud, depicting a dog named Nipper listening to a recording of his late master's voice. RCA obtained the rights to this logo when it acquired the Victor Talking Machine Company, and it became a symbol of quality and innovation in the audio industry.</p>

    <h3>Personal Note</h3>
    <p>I inherited this unit from my late mother in law. My wife and her sister were cleaning out the house, they discovered it under a stack of blankets in the back of a closet in a spare bedroom. No one in the family knew when it was purchased or where it came from. Indeed neither my wife or her sister ever remember seeing it, even in their youth.</p>
    <p>Oddly no one else in the family wanted it, so my darling sweet wonderful awesome loving wife spoke up and said "I'll bet Robert would love to have it!"</p>
    <p>Ahh, my bride knows me well. I refused to let the movers handle it, I went and packed it myself and brought it home, wrapped carefully in moving blakets in the back seat of my pickup truck.</p>
    <p>(Yeah, I know, I have a big bed in my truck, but when you have something almost 100 years old you don't want to take any risks. Hence the back seat it was!)</p>
